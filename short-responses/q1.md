# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
Middleware is supposed to be the middleman between the front end and back end. Middleware will check it first to ensure the contents are correct. Middleware is apart of the backend.

While correct, this is one way middleware can be used, rather than how it differentiates from a normal controller. 

What makes middleware different from a normal controller function is that middleware performs tasks (like validation, logging, etc.) and then passes control to the next function using next(). Controllers, on the other hand, handle sending the final response to the user.
