# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
Middleware is supposed to be the middleman between the front end and back end. Instead of information reaching the back end directly, middleware will check it first to ensure the contents are correct.
# Teacher Feedback

Middleware is a part of the backend but yes it is a step that is taken before fully processing a request.
