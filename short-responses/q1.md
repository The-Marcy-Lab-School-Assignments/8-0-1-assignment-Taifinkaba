# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
Middleware is supposed to be the middleman between the front end and back end. Middleware will check it first to ensure the contents are correct. Middleware is apart of the backend.
# Teacher Feedback

Middleware is a part of the backend but yes it is a step that is taken before fully processing a request.
