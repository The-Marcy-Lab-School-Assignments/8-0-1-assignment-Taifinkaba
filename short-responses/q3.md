# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are files that donâ€™t change and are served directly to the client. In React, we need to first generate our static assets by running the command `npm run dev`. In a React project, static assets include files like images, fonts, and other media, rather than HTML or CSS, which can be dynamically generated or modified.
