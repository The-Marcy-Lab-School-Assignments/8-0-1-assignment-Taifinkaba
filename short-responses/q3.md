# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are files that donâ€™t change and are served directly to the client. In a React project, static assets include files like images, fonts, and other media, rather than HTML or CSS, which can be dynamically generated or modified.
